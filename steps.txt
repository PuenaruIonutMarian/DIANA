 command used for querying balance from the terminal, slightly changed from her version, and that command is:

dfx canister call token_backend balanceOf "( $OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY )"

STEPS that folow:

Any import 

import { token_backend as token } from '../../../declarations/token_backend';

I used the "as token" clause, so that it should be easy to use the word "token" 

checking canister id:

dfx canister id token_backend



Save canister ID into a command line variable as follows:

CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister id token_backend )\""



Transfer half a billion tokens to the canister Principal ID as follows:

dfx canister call token_backend transfer "($CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY, 500_000_000)"
